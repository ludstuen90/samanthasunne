		<p>My main focus is freelance investigative reporting in Louisiana. I publish with New Orleans outlets as well as smaller, more local newspapers that desperately need more government accountability coverage. In 2018, I won second place for Investigative Reporting at the New Orleans Press Club awards, and in 2019 I was named one of the 100 most influential people in tech in Louisiana.</p>

		  <p>I publish a <a href="toolsforreporters.com">newsletter</a> that introduces journalists to a useful new tool every other week. This project aims to help reporters keep up with the onslaught of digital development in an approachable, hands-on way. The newsletter has tripled in subscribers since 2017, and has been recommended by Poynter, the Society for Professional Journalists, and the Lenfest Institute.</p>

      <p>I work on several ongoing projects relating to the current misinformation crisis. In 2018, I spoke on a "fake news" panel in Moscow, helped organize a MisinfoCon conference in London, and was invited to Harvard to brainstorm best practices with other anti-misinfo trainers. In 2017, I gave a talk about threat modeling against misinformation in Serbia.</p>

      <p>As of January 2019, I'm helping Emojination add more representative emojis to the Unicode library. In 2016, I participated in the Berlin Capital Program of the Fulbright Commission, and in 2018, did a similar trip in Moscow with Creative Diplomacy. I taught myself Swedish but mostly forgot it, and learned Spanish and forgot only some of it. I am also working on reaching Level 2 in Krav Maga 🙇‍♂️</p>
